## Title of the Project:
Electricity Bill Optimization Application

## Small Description:
The Electricity Bill Optimization and Prediction Web Application is designed to help users estimate their monthly electricity bills based on energy consumption patterns and tariff slabs, while also providing insights to optimize electricity usage and reduce costs.

## About


The Electricity Bill Optimization and Prediction Web Application is a user-friendly web-based system developed to predict electricity bills for domestic and commercial consumers. Traditional electricity billing systems often lack transparency, making it difficult for users to estimate their expenses in advance. This project addresses that challenge by allowing users to input their electricity consumption details and instantly receive an estimated bill.

The application provides an intuitive interface with dedicated pages for Home, Help, and Bill Prediction (Try Now). By leveraging predefined tariff slabs and consumption logic, the system calculates the estimated bill efficiently. In addition to prediction, the application also promotes energy awareness by offering optimization tips to reduce electricity usage.

This project demonstrates the effective use of web technologies to build an accessible and practical solution that enhances user awareness, improves financial planning, and supports sustainable energy consumption.

## Features

Predicts monthly electricity bills based on consumption units.
Supports domestic and commercial consumer categories.
User-friendly and responsive web interface.
Real-time bill calculation with instant results.

## Requirements


Operating System: Windows 10 / Ubuntu (64-bit recommended).

Development Environment: Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Frontend Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.

IDE: Visual Studio Code for development and debugging.

Version Control: Git for source code management.

Hardware Requirements: Minimum 4 GB RAM, standard processor.

Additional Tools: Internet connection for loading fonts and libraries (optional).

## System Architecture

The system follows a simple client-side web architecture.
The user interacts with the web interface through the browser.
Input data (units consumed and consumer type) is processed using JavaScript logic.
Tariff-based calculation logic computes the estimated electricity bill.
The predicted bill is displayed instantly on the user interface.
